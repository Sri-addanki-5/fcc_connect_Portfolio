# Farmer Customer Connect

### Project Description
The Farmer Customer Connect is an web application built using React JS, Mongo DB , Node JS and Express. Usually these technologies are called as MERN. This web application is like an E-Commerce website used by both farmers and customers to buy and sell vegetables, dairy products, fruitsetc. In this Web application  farmers can register themselves and sell their produce at a suitable price. Customers can various vegitables, dairy products, and fruits from their home for a nominal price. This Web application connects both farmer's and customer's digitally making it easier for farmer's to sell their products at ease without any intermediate buyers. This Web application is mainly aims to remove the middle men so that the farmer's can sell their products at a suitable price.


### Problems faced by farmer's and customer's
Many Farmer's are ending up in losses because they are unable to find a better price for their product at the regional market. The interference of the middle men is no of the major problem the farmer's facing now a days. The similar applies to the customer too, due to the interference of the middle men the customer's end up buying various products for too much price. To eradicate this problem we are working on this 'Farmer Customer Connect" web application.
