# Farmer Customer Connect

### Project Description
The Farmer Customer Connect is an web application built using React JS, Mongo DB , Node JS and Express. Usually these technologies are called as MERN. This web application is like an E-Commerce website used by both farmers and customers to buy and sell vegetables, dairy products, fruitsetc. In this Web application  farmers can register themselves and sell their produce at a suitable price. Customers can various vegitables, dairy products, and fruits from their home for a nominal price. This Web application connects both farmer's and customer's digitally making it easier for farmer's to sell their products at ease without any intermediate buyers. This Web application is mainly aims to remove the middle men so that the farmer's can sell their products at a suitable price.


### Problems faced by farmer's and customer's
Many Farmer's are ending up in losses because they are unable to find a better price for their product at the regional market. The interference of the middle men is no of the major problem the farmer's facing now a days. The similar applies to the customer too, due to the interference of the middle men the customer's end up buying various products for too much price. To eradicate this problem we are working on this 'Farmer Customer Connect" web application.


### Technologies Used

Frontend : React JS

Backend : Node JS, Express JS and Mongo DB

Tesing Tools: JEST

Code Versioning Systems : Git and GitHub

### Sprint 1: Learnings
In first sprint we have learned about the SCRUM methodology and various attibutes and aspects in SCRUM. Later, we decided on what technologies we had to use to implement this Web application. Moreover, we have decided to work on MERN technolgies. Further, we worked on basics of these MERN technologies. In addition to that, we have learnt how to create user stories along with creation of branches in the GitHub Website. Also, we have worked on the MERN and created a simple Signin page which takes the details from the user and stores it in the database..

### Sprint 2: Learnings
In the second sprint we started working on a User story to implement the “SignIn/SignUp/SignOut” page for farmer and customer. We have created the fronted i.e. UI using the React JS. later used Express, Node to create a backend and we were using MongoDB as a database to store the data from the user. The user should give his First Name, Last Name, Email Address, Password to signup to the web application in order to see his profile. We tried to implement the Google Authentication also but we have faced issues related to the database, so we worked on the traditional way of signing up process. Later, we have created the Signin page where the user can give his details like Email Address and Password to get access to his account. Morever, after signing in he can also sign out from the website using the sign out option
### Sprint 3: Learnings
In the third sprint we have completed the basic signin/signup/signout process. Later, we have integrated all the signin and signup pages which were made separately from the beginning. After that, we have implement JWT system to our signin/signup process where a token is generated everytime when a user login’s to the application. Moreover, after the user has signout of the page he will not any access to the previous pages when he clicks on the back button. In addition to that, we have worked on the JEST to test application we have built until now. Additionally, we have updated some of the user stories along with acceptance criteria.
